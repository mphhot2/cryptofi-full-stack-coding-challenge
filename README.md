# Coding Challenge Readme

Welcome to the InvestiFi Full-Stack Engineering coding challenge! This challenge is designed to assess your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and "grit". Before you begin, please take a moment to read through this readme to understand the challenge requirements, instructions, and guidelines.

## Challenge Description

### API Overview
In this challenge, you will be asked to create a simple api endpoint that will allow a user to get a list of crypto prices, along with the user's balances. This part of the coding challenge will require you to get familiar with libraries such as FastApi, Pydantic, and Dyntastic. 
The prices should be ordered by the most amount of holdings a user has, for all the coins that the user holds, then alpabetically.
The prices and balances will be pre-populated in the database. You will not need to create any routes for creating or updating the prices and balances.

A FastApi app has already been created for you in the `/api` directory.

### Requirements
- A GET route that returns ordered prices and balances for a specific user. 
  - The balances should be ordered by the most amount of holdings a user has, for all the coins that the user holds, then alphabetically.
    - For Example - If User `1` has 10 BTC, 5 ETH, 5 LTC, 0 XLM, and 0 BCH, the balances should be returned in the order of BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, XLM
  - The route should accept a user id as a parameter. 
    - For example - I pass in User `1`, I will receive the user's balances for User `1`

### Frontend Overview
For the frontend part of the coding challenge, you will be asked to display the cryptocurrencies in order. This part of the coding challenge will require you to get familiar with React and typescript.
We should also be able to switch between the 2 users available. This can be done with a dropdown or a button. We expect to see the use of [context](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) for this part of the challenge.

A React app has already been created for you in the `/frontend` directory. You can also find the logos for the cryptocurrencies in the `/frontend/src/assets` directory.

### Requirements
- List out all prices and balances on the frontend
  - [Here](https://github.com/CryptoFi-LLC/cryptofi-full-stack-coding-challenge/blob/main/frontend/public/Balance-List-Example.png) is an example of what the frontend should look like
- List out the 2 users available and be able to switch back and forth between them
  - This can be done with a dropdown or a button
  - The balances shown should update when switching between users

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the challenge:

1. **Clone**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
2. **New Private Repo**: Create a new private repo on your personal github account from the cloned coding challenge repo.
3. **Local Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. For Mac users, the easiest way to do this is by downloading [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Ensure `Make` is installed on your computer. For Mac Users this should already be pre installed
4. **Commands**
   - **Note:** these commands should be run in a terminal window from the root of the project.
   - `make run` - start api
   - `make stop` - stops api and removes database
   - `make bash` - opens terminal window inside running api docker container. This is useful for running the test suite directly from the running container vs using `make run-testsuite`. This is an advanced command.
   - `make destroy` - cleans all unused docker containers from your machine. This should only be used too free up memory post code challenge completion.
5. **What's Provided**
   - A Dockerized API which will run on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - Autogenerated api docs for testing [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
   - A React Frontend which will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - A Local DynamoDb Gui for viewing data in the database [http://localhost:8001/](http://localhost:8001/)

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your solution, follow these steps:

1. **Commit Changes**: Make sure to commit your code changes locally.
1. **Push to GitHub**: Push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. **Invite Us**: Invite @RamseyV @mattg87 and @dysfunctioning to review the repo
1. **Loom Video**: Create a short [loom video](https://www.loom.com/) (5 minutes or less) describing your approach and demoing the coding challenge. 
1. **Email**: Once complete, please reach out to [Jennifer](jennifer.preston@investifi.co) our HR representive with the loom video attached and we will be in touch!

In your pull request, include the following:

- A brief description of the approach you took to solve the challenge.
- Any relevant notes, assumptions, or trade-offs you made during the development process.

## Evaluation Criteria
